# Python API Challenge
This project is intended to find weather patterns based on how close cities are to the equator, and then use this to find ideal cities for a vacation. 

## Code Source
For this project, I worked with classmates, Matthew and Jenni to work on various parts of the project. I also used previous classwork to create the code as well as ChatGPT to troubleshoot.

The data came from Geoapify API and OpenWeatherMap API.
